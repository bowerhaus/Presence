# Project Status: Presence Detection System

## üö® CRITICAL: All TV Control Methods Failed
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-18
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Need new approach after multiple control method failures

### Failed Control Methods Summary:

#### 1. Samsung Direct Network Control ‚ùå FAILED
**Issues:**
- Samsung WebSocket API fails intermittently from presence sensor
- TV gets stuck in standby mode with "WebSocket power toggle failed after 3 attempts"
- Connection reuse issues causing stale WebSocket connections
- Wake-on-LAN unreliable from standby mode
- Complex state management with poor reliability

#### 2. Samsung CEC Control ‚ùå FAILED  
**Issues:**
- CEC power-on has 25-second cooldown after power-off
- CEC power-off does not work reliably
- No reliable power state feedback mechanism
- Hardware complexity with limited functionality

#### 3. Direct Tapo PyP100 Control ‚ùå FAILED
**Issues:**
- PyP100 connection failed despite correct credentials
- Authentication errors with TP-Link cloud services
- Inconsistent API behavior with newer firmware

#### 4. Amazon Alexa AlexaPy Control ‚ùå FAILED
**Issues:**
- AlexaPy login fails due to Amazon security measures
- Requires 2FA/captcha handling not supported by library
- Amazon actively blocks unofficial API access
- Unofficial library with no guarantee of continued functionality

### Root Cause Analysis:
All attempted control methods rely on unofficial APIs, proprietary protocols, or cloud services that are either unreliable or actively restricted by vendors.

## üìã FAILED ATTEMPTS DOCUMENTATION

### ‚ùå Alexa AlexaPy Integration (ABANDONED)
**Status:** FAILED - AlexaPy cannot authenticate with Amazon
**Date:** 2025-09-18

#### What Was Attempted:
- [x] Installed AlexaPy library v1.29.8
- [x] Created alexa_tv_control.py module with async/sync interfaces
- [x] Updated config.json with Amazon credentials
- [x] Integrated with presence_sensor.py
- [x] Created test scripts

#### Failure Points:
- Amazon login fails due to security measures (2FA/captcha)
- AlexaPy is unofficial and Amazon actively blocks such access
- No reliable way to bypass Amazon's authentication requirements
- Library may break at any time due to Amazon changes

#### Lessons Learned:
- Unofficial APIs for major cloud services are unreliable
- Amazon has strong anti-automation measures
- Voice control works manually but programmatic access is blocked

## üßπ CODEBASE CLEANUP NEEDED

### Files to Archive/Remove:
- `alexa_tv_control.py` - Failed Alexa integration
- `test_alexa_control.py` - Failed test script
- AlexaPy dependency in requirements
- Alexa config section in config.json

### Failed Code Artifacts:
- Samsung WebSocket reconnection logic
- CEC control implementation 
- Tapo PyP100 integration attempts
- AlexaPy authentication code

### What to Keep:
- Core presence detection (UART sensor working)
- Configuration framework
- Logging infrastructure
- Basic TV control interface structure

## Previous Phases (For Reference)

### ~~Samsung Network Control Implementation~~ ‚ùå DEPRECATED
**Status:** üî¥ FAILED - Unreliable in production
**Reason:** WebSocket API intermittent failures, connection management issues

---

## ‚úÖ MILESTONE: Samsung Network Control Implementation (2025-08-28)
**Status:** üü¢ COMPLETED  
**Objective:** Replace IR/CEC control with Samsung network API for reliable TV control

### Completed Implementation:
1. **‚úÖ Samsung Network Library Integration**
   - Installed `samsungtvws[async,encrypted]` in virtual environment
   - Full support for Samsung Frame TV network control via WebSocket API
   - Eliminated IR blaster hardware dependency (GPIO 24 now available)

2. **‚úÖ Configuration Updates**
   - Added `samsung_tv` section with network settings (IP, port, token, Wake-on-LAN)
   - Configured TV discovery and MAC address detection
   - Disabled `ir` and `cec` sections (kept as backup)

3. **‚úÖ Samsung TV Controller Module (`samsung_tv_control.py`)**
   - Network connectivity checking and retry logic
   - Accurate power state detection using Samsung's `PowerState` API (`on`/`standby`)
   - Smart multi-strategy power control (WebSocket, Wake-on-LAN, CEC fallback)
   - Comprehensive error handling and SSL warning suppression

4. **‚úÖ Updated Presence Sensor (`presence_sensor.py`)**
   - Integrated Samsung network control instead of IR
   - Maintained same timing logic (immediate on, 10min delay off)
   - Added development mode with dry-run testing

5. **‚úÖ TV Discovery Tool (`discover_samsung_tv.py`)**
   - Network scanning to find Samsung TVs automatically
   - Auto-configuration of IP address, port, and MAC address for Wake-on-LAN

### Key Technical Insights Discovered:
- ‚ùå Samsung WebSocket API **does not support** explicit `KEY_POWERON`/`KEY_POWEROFF` commands
- ‚úÖ Samsung WebSocket API **only supports** `KEY_POWER` (toggle) commands  
- ‚úÖ Samsung `PowerState` API accurately reports TV state: `on`, `standby`, or unreachable
- ‚úÖ WebSocket toggle works reliably: `on` ‚Üî `standby` 
- ‚úÖ Wake-on-LAN works for fully powered-off TVs (requires MAC address)

### Optimal Control Strategy Implemented:
**Power ON (Smart State-Aware):**
1. If TV reports `on` ‚Üí Already on, return success
2. If TV reports `standby` ‚Üí Use WebSocket toggle (instant, reliable)
3. If TV unreachable ‚Üí Wake-on-LAN + WebSocket toggle fallback
4. CEC backup (with 25s cooldown tracking)

**Power OFF:**
1. WebSocket toggle: `on` ‚Üí `standby` (Samsung TVs stay network-reachable in standby)
2. Accurate standby detection via PowerState API

### Available Commands:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (required)
source venv/bin/activate

# TV Discovery and Configuration
python3 discover_samsung_tv.py

# Power Control (now working reliably)
python3 samsung_tv_control.py ensure-on    # Smart context-aware power on
python3 samsung_tv_control.py ensure-off   # Smart context-aware power off
python3 samsung_tv_control.py status       # Accurate power state detection
python3 samsung_tv_control.py on/off/toggle/info

# Presence System Testing
python3 presence_sensor.py --dev --dry-run --verbose
```

**Success Criteria MET:** ‚úÖ TV reliably controlled via network API with accurate state detection

   - Sensor state transitions detected (HIGH/LOW presence detection)
   - Hardware debouncing and state management implemented

3. **‚úÖ End-to-End System Validation**
   - ‚úÖ Presence Detection: Real sensor triggers immediate TV power-on
   - ‚úÖ Samsung Network Control: TV turned on successfully via WebSocket API
   - ‚úÖ Timing Logic: 10-minute delay timer activated on presence loss
   - ‚úÖ State Management: Proper transitions between presence/no-presence states

### ‚ùå **Rejected: IR + CEC Hybrid**
**Limitations Discovered:**
- CEC power-on has 25-second cooldown after power-off
- CEC power-off does not work reliably
- IR requires line-of-sight and hardware complexity
